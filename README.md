# Personal Website and Calculator web-based application
#### Video Demo:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cu1iYU4uTc>
#### Description:
My final project is a Personal Website that has a Calculator web-application embedded with the website. To begin with, the personal website has the main page which has information about me in addition to a gif background—that is the same across the whole website— for my website instead of a static background in order to give the website a more lively feeling. However, this also might be the reason why the website takes longer to upload.
Then I can navigate to the Contact Me, Projects, and Certificates pages. I have used a link inside a bar that is at the top of the page of the website, which could navigate you to any page you want. When visiting the Contact Me page, you can find a link that takes you to my Twitter, LinkedIn, or GitHub.  I have used the same template for those links as the ones I have used earlier for the navigation bar, so that is why they might have a lot of properties and attributes in common inside the CSS file.
Then, there is the Projects page. Although, I do not currently have every single project of mine in there, I am working on grouping them all together and keep developing on the website by adding them. In that page you will find the link to my main final project, which is a Calculator web-application. It is a simple calculator with a simple design. I have used  html, CSS, and JavaScript for this calculator. I also had some help and hints from websites such as w3schools, geeksforgeeks, and freecodecamp. I have used these websites mostly to discover new properties for CSS and learn about new tags in HTML.
I have used a separate styling sheet for my Calculator projects and linked it to my main index. However, I have embedded my Javascript code inside with the html code. For the JavaScript code, I have three main function that do all of the calculator job, and they are as follows:
function add(num) {
document.form.answer.value = document.form.answer.value + num;
}
This function takes the value from the text box that the user types in the numbers, and then uses the next Javascript function for the results.
eval(form.answer.value )
    This is the function that automatically takes the numbers the user typed along with the   symbols (*, /, +, -) and compute them to split the result.
function wipe() {
              document.form.answer.value = ""
    }
    This is a specific function for the button © that wipes out the inputs of the user on the answer box.

The next page is my Certificates page, which has the links to the certificates I have taken from online courses. I have used the same template that I used earlier for the links, yet this time I have made some edits on the aesthetics of the button-like links to look fit for the page.
That is it for my Personal Website and Calculator project. 

This is CS50!
